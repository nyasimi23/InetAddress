# LocalHost Information

LocalHost Information is a simple Java program that retrieves and displays information about the local host. It uses the `InetAddress` class from the Java standard library to get the host name and IP address of the local machine.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- A Java IDE or compiler to run the program (e.g., VS Code,  IntelliJ, or javac command-line tool).

### How to run in VS Code

1. **Install Java Extension Pack** 
1. **Open your Java file:** Open the `LocalHostInfo.java` file in Visual Studio Code.
1. **Run the Java file** 
    - Press `F5` or use the "Run and Debug" button in the left sidebar.
    - VS Code will compile and run the LocalHostInfo.java file.
1. When you run the program, it will retrieve the host name and IP address of the local machine.
1. The program will then display the retrieved information on the console.


### Example Output
```
Host Name: my-computer
IP Address: 192.168.1.100
```

## Troubleshooting

- If the program displays "Unable to retrieve local host information," it may indicate an issue with the network configuration or your system's settings.
