## Network Information Java Programs

This repository contains four simple Java programs that provide network-related information. Each program focuses on retrieving specific network details.

## Programs

1. `HostIP.java`: Retrieves the IP address associated with a given hostname using the InetAddress class.

1. `LoopbackAddressInfo.java`: Retrieves and displays the loopback address (localhost) using the InetAddress class.

2. `IPaddressResolver.java`: Retrieves the IP address associated with a given URL (hostname) using the InetAddress class.

3. `LocalHostInfo.java`: Retrieves the host name and IP address of the local machine using the InetAddress class.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- A Java IDE or compiler to run the program (e.g., VS Code,  IntelliJ, or javac command-line tool).


### How to run

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
1. Open a Java IDE or your favorite code editor (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ, or Visual Studio Code).
1. Import the Java files into your Java project.
1. Compile and run each Java file to execute the corresponding program.


### Troubleshooting

- If any program encounters an issue, such as an unknown host or inability to retrieve information, check your network connectivity and ensure that you have entered valid inputs.
